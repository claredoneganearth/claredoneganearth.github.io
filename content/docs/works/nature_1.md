# Wild Soft
_Wild Soft_ I emerges from a sustained, personal relationship with the natural world. These images trace a cyclical passage through the seasons, shaped largely by the landscapes of Yorkshire, where change is gradual, tactile, and deeply felt. The work reflects time spent observing growth, decay, and renewal, allowing nature to be encountered as both environment and presence. A smaller section, made during time in the lush greens of Thailand, offers a contrasting rhythm and density, expanding the cycle while reinforcing a shared sense of vitality, interconnectedness, and continuity across place.
