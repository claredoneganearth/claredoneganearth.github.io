# Wild Soft
I walked the same path almost every day, over a period of a decade. Always carrying a film camera… a small promise to slowness. The light was always unpredictable, always Yorkshire. It fell gently into the frame, grain settling like pollen on a distant memory. Leaves blurred, edges breathed, and the world revealed itself. Softly wild.
