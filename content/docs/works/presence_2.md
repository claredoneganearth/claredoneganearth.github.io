## Cologne
Every year on February 18th, the streets of Cologne transform into a vibrant carnival of colour, rhythm, and collective expression. For me, documenting this event is an invitation to witness the interplay of tradition and spontaneity, where individual presence becomes part of a larger, ever-shifting tapestry. I chose to work in monochrome as a way of recalibrating attention within the intensity of carnival. By removing colour, the images invite a closer reading of gesture, texture, expression, and spatial relationships. Monochrome allows the visual “loudness” of the event to be translated into contrast, rhythm, and form, offering a different register of engagement. This approach creates space to explore how energy, individuality, and collective presence can be felt beyond spectacle.

## Los Angeles
Photographing Venice Beach in Los Angeles offered an encounter with an immensely eclectic and layered community. The area brings together people whose lives are shaped by vastly different circumstances, from those navigating homelessness to Vietnam veterans carrying decades of lived history. Approaching these portraits was an act of listening and respect, recognizing the depth of experience shared in each interaction. It was an honour to photograph individuals who were generous with their time and stories, and to create images that reflect their presence, kindness, humour, and humanity within a space that is both transient and deeply personal.
