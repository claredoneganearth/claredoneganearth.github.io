Still Point explores a cross-cultural dance exchange between Paris and Halifax, West Yorkshire. Inspired by the Tour de France - Grand Départ that was passing through the region at this time. The images capture choreography by young dancers in Halifax as they dance with and subsequently merge with their dance partners in Paris via a live video stream.
