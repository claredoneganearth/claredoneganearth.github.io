This show reel traces a body of work rooted in experimentation, attentiveness, and collective imagination. In West Yorkshire, I led Inna Nature as creative producer, project manager, and arts facilitator, developing participatory projects with vulnerable adults through collage, photography, nature connection, and mindfulness-led workshops. The reel also captures my work with Outta Place as creative producer and assistant choreographer, where cutting-edge uses of telepresence enabled street and contemporary dance to dissolve distance, spark dialogue, and build transnational connections between young people. Across these projects, creativity becomes a connective force, one that challenges convention, expands access, and empowers participants to be seen, heard, and creatively present in the world.
