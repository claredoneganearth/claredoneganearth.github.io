# Showreel
{{% columns ratio="1:1" %}} 
- This show reel traces a body of work rooted in experimentation, attentiveness, and collective imagination. In West Yorkshire, I led _Inna Nature_ as creative producer, project manager, and arts facilitator, developing participatory projects with vulnerable adults through collage, photography, and mindfulness-led workshops. I facilitated nature-connection practices using outdoor, sensory-led processes to support reflection, grounding, and embodied engagement with place.

- The reel also captures my work with _Outta Place_ as creative producer and assistant choreographer, where cutting-edge uses of telepresence enabled street and contemporary dance to dissolve distance, spark dialogue, and build transnational connections between young people. Across these projects, creativity becomes a connective force, one that challenges convention, expands access, and empowers participants to be seen, heard, and creatively present in the world.
